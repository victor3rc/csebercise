Obeject Oriented programming exercise with Python

The aim of this repository is to provide a task where the user has to make use of, and thus learn, different aspects of object oriented programming. The problem to be solved can be described as follows:

A road of `k` kilometres, with `l` lanes, has been poorly constructed. Each kilometre has an impact of magnitude `x` on the suspension of a vehicle. 

The road is given in a csv file, where each line represents a kilometre. The damage each kilometre has on a car's suspension is given as an integer. Therefore, a 4 lane road, of 5 kilometres may be given as:

```
4,5,6,2
2,3,7,6
1,8,3,5
0,2,1,6
6,2,4,9
```

The first lane has a total damage impact of 13 (4 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 6), the second 20 (5 + 3 + 8 + 2 + 2), and so on.

A vehicle may have the following characteristics:

* Weight.
* Fuel quantity.
* Suspension strength.
* Spare tires.
* Automated steering assistance, to avoid potholes.
